>Normal teletext consists of a series of pages, which are
      transmitted in quick succession by the broadcaster. Whenever you
      want your TV to tune in on a specific page, your TV will capture
      that page only and show it on the screen.</P
><P
>Every page can have subpages, that is: the page consists
      of a couple of subpages. This way the numbering of pages can
      stay the same, but the amount of information in a page can vary.
      For example: the page that serves the news (101 on Dutch TV) can
      have just a few items of information (nothing happened in the
      world), and thus have no subpages, or it can have a lot of
      items, spread out on subpages.  These subpages are usually
      automatically updated on your TV, timed by an interval in which
      the page can be read. This means that if you want to see subpage
      7 and the current displayed subpage is 3, you'll have to wait
      some time. This can be very annoying. Also, if the timing is to
      fast, the page may have disappeared before you've read it, which
      means that you'll have to wait for the page to come up
      again.</P
><P
>Using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>TeleGNOME</SPAN
> is very similar to using teletext on any
      regular television set, but without the sometimes irritating
      long waits for a page to come up.</P
><P
>Just like teletext on a TV, you can simply type a page
      number and press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>ENTER</B
> to load that page. This
      number can be any number served by the current teletext channel,
      and it is not restricted to the numbers shown on the current
      page.</P
><P
>You can load subpages directly by typing the pagenumber, a
      dash or a slash and the subpagenumber. For example: if you want
      to load the second page of page 201, just type
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>201/2</B
>.</P
><P
>When you're ready to read the next subpage (if any) you
      can press the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>next</B
>-button. This will load the
      next subpage. Alternatively you can just enter the requested
      subpage immediately using the keyboard.</P
